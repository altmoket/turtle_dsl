# Turtle DSL

## Project Description
Turtle DSL is a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide intuitive instructions for the Python Turtle graphics library. This project allows users to define shapes and their properties in a simple and readable syntax, enabling easy drawing on a canvas.

## Example Syntax
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Turtle DSL:

```plaintext
shape triangle
    line red
    fill yellow
    line E 400
    line N 300
    line 126.9 deg 500
end

shape square
    line blue
    fill #aaffaa
    line S 100
    line W 100
    line N 100
    line E 100
end

shape black_and_white
    line E 150
    line NW 71
    line W 50
    line SW 71
end

draw triangle // The default position is 0,0, the center of the canvas
draw square at -10, -10
draw black_and_white at 225, 150
```

## Features
